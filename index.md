## The blog creation process

  There seems to be many ways of creating a blog, but the process was at first a bit cloudy through the learn curriculum.  Clicking on the "Blog" tab of the page opens a set of options:  "Blog Dashboard", "Blog Settings", "Your Blog", and "Magazine".  When "Blog Dashboard" is selected, it has topics for a blog, but no instructions for how to create a blog.  Rather, it asks you to enter a link to your already existing blog post.  When we select "Blog Settings", it simply provides a field for updating the url of an already existing blog.  When "Your Blog" is clicked from the menu, it opens a blank page.  I assume it would open up a page to your blog if you already had one.  Finally, when one selects the "Magazine" option from the menu, it just opens up a page with links to blogs that others have created.  I had to research on my own to figure out that a blog could be created through #Github Pages# located at the url https://pages.github.com/ .
  From there, you can use Jekyll to style the page.   


### Creating the Command Line Interface
  The process was straight forward, and this is where I began the project from, because like Avi suggested, it seems to be the simplest point of entry.  Once you have established what the user experience should be like, the rest of the code just kind of takes shape almost on its own.  

### Find the source
  It was pretty simple to do a Google search and find multiple pages that offered global exchance rates.  I sought one out for a table that I could iterate over in order to list and retrieve the necessary data requested by the user.  Beyond this, it was simply a matter of storing each currency as a unique object containing data relevant to that specific unit of currency.
