## The importance of self development

The difference between a person who is a child, and one who is an adult is that an adult need not be dependent upon someone else.  For a person to make a transition from child to adult, the idea has to be absorbed that one should seek help from others the least amount possible, and develop ourselves to the point of not needing any help.  It's about taking responsibility.  

Unfortunately, during the learning process a person is totally dependent on external sources of knowledge.  In this day and age, it is a miracle that we have access to the information superhighway known as the internet, from which we can draw much more massive quantities of knowledge than ever existed before.  In some cases though, communication between human beings is far superior, and far more effective than communication with machines, and therefore I am grateful to have access to the teachings of others.  

### Blogging
Is a new experience for me.  I'm very effective at communicating with words when I have time to think them out, and so it's kind of surprising that I never got into blogging before.  This is a newfound superpower for me.  I have so many things to say, I don't even really know where to start. 


### Somewhat scatterbrained
I don't know if attention deficit disorder is really a thing or not, but at times I can find myself having trouble getting organized.  I don't believe this to be related at all to my general intelligence, but rather that my mind seems to dart around from one subject to another very quickly if it is not being challenged by whatever it is that I'm doing right at the moment.  It can make my life challenging at times, but I have no problem staying entertained and I supposed it helps me with multitasking.  I theorize however that if I could concentrate better I probably would get a lot more accomplished.
